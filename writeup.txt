Features:
    Changes the faces of the blobs

Bugs:
    Processing collisions and blowing up of blobs 
    -- ended up adjusting stiffness constant and
    dampening the springs to fix the blobs blowing up 
    in a collision (found it difficult to know if 
    code had a logical error or constant was too small/large)
